Original data include x and y components (VX and VY, respectively) projected to EPSG3031 at 450 m resolutions. It is resampled at 20 km intervals, and the flow direction sym_angle (degrees) is derived using sum_angle = arctan(VY/VX). The arrow length sym_length is exponentially proportional to the speed, i.e. sym_length = log_e(sqrt(VX^2 + XY^2). Other minor arrow shapes slightly depends on the speed.
