# this environment is used to run the Figure 1 script. It is based around pyGMT.

# 'SMB'
# this environment is used to run the SMBcorr scripts (https://smbcorr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Example usage of SMBcorr is located in '/figure_scripts/SMBcorr_command'

# 'henv'
# this environment is used to run scripts for Figures 2-5.
