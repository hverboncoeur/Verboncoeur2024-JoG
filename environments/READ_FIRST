# In the environments folder you will find the four Python environments used for this project. Eventually we will try to consolidate 
# the environments into one or two. Here are their descriptions:

# 'verb2024fig1'
# this environment is used to run the Figure 1 script. It is based around pyGMT.

# 'SMB'
# this environment is used to run the SMBcorr scripts (https://smbcorr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Example usage of SMBcorr is located in '/figure_scripts/SMBcorr_command'

# 'dhdt'
# this environment is used to run the dh/dt calculation script.

# 'henv'
# this environment is used to run the script for producing Figures 2-5.
